                IDENTIFICATION OF SLUMS</b></h4>

            <p>
                Slums are identified using geographic information system (GIS) which is a conceptualized framework that
                provides the ability to capture and analyze spatial and geographic data. With the varying intensity of
                the image captured the change in the population or area occupied by the slum is calculated. Street view
                also enabled to have better visualization of slum along with living conditions.

            <h4><b>AREA ANALYSIS</b></h4>

            <p>
                Area analysis is an amalgamation of a list containing geographical features of a particular area, soil
                type,
                projects
                being and already implemented in that area and constructions that are supported in that region based on
                soil
                testing.

        <p>
            Categorized maps are the domain where the slums can be identified based on Population density or Area
            Occupied
            by
            the
            slum.

            <h4><b>
                Population density-based map</b></h4>

            <p>
                POPULATION DENSITY MAPS are typically derived from census data and aggregated into arbitrary areal units
                such as
                census
                tracts, block groups, or at best census blocks. The major assumption with this representation is that
                within
                the
                boundary of the areal unit the population density is homogeneous. While in dense urban areas comprised
                of
                small
                areal
                units this assumption may be relatively accurate, population densities in larger census block groups
                outside
                of the
                urban center often differ significantly within the block group boundary. This technique can be improved
                by
                using
                ancillary data sources such as topographic maps, satellite imagery, and land cover datasets to estimate
                the
                true
                population distribution. Dasymetric mapping can be used to categorize geography into inhabitable and
                uninhabitable
                regions based on predefined density values for different settlement patterns. </p>
